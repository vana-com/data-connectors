# Scope Coverage Registry

**The single reference for every data scope, how it can be fulfilled (web vs.
desktop), and the exact connectors behind it.**

This file is **maintained by hand.** It is the source of truth people read when
they need to answer "can the web flow produce `instagram.ads`?" (it can't — see
the table). There is intentionally no generator and no automated sync: the set
of web-fulfillable scopes changes rarely, so when it changes, edit this file
directly. (Background: [BUI-395](https://linear.app/vana-team/issue/BUI-395/instagram-scope-mismatch-found-in-cg-lab-e2e).)

## How to read this

- **Web** — the scope can be produced by the ODL **Data Pipe API**
  (`data-pipe.vana.org`), the hosted "light" flow used by the Vana Web app. Today
  the Data Pipe API produces only `*.profile`, and only for the five sources it
  has been wired for (Instagram, Spotify, YouTube, LinkedIn, GitHub). Update this
  column **by hand** when the Data Pipe API gains a new source/scope.
- **Desktop** — the scope can be produced by a Playwright **connector** in this
  repo (the heavy flow, run via the Data Connect desktop app). Derived from the
  connector manifests + `registry.json`.
- **Connectors** — the exact connector id(s) that fulfill the scope, with status.
  A scope may be served by more than one connector.

> A request for a scope marked Desktop-only (e.g. `instagram.ads`) cannot be
> satisfied by the web flow alone — the Personal Server will have no data for it.
> That is the exact mismatch BUI-395 surfaced.

¹ **`instagram.posts` on Web is capped at the 150 most recent posts.** The Data
Pipe API web flow returns at most 150 posts; for a complete post history use the
Desktop connector (`instagram-playwright`), which has no such limit.

## Maintaining this file

- **A connector adds/removes a scope** → update the Desktop rows + Connector(s)
  column for that source.
- **The Data Pipe API gains a web-fulfillable scope** → flip its **Web** cell to
  ✅. Keep `unity-surfaces` `web-writable-scopes.ts` consistent with the Web
  column by hand (the web app changes infrequently enough that this is fine).
